#summary Instructions on running the experiment scripts.

= Introduction =

Before you can run the experiment scripts, you will need to install the repository and all of the dragonbot code: [http://code.google.com/p/yale-ros-pkg/wiki/DragonbotPubSubInstall].

= Additional Setup =

  # Regenerate the phrase information file:
{{{
> roscd expeditions_year1
> ./regen_phrases.sh
}}}
  # Use ifconfig to find the IP address of your computer; you'll need to set ROS_IP and ROS_HOSTNAME for the background nodes and the main experiment node (see below).
{{{
> ifconfig
}}}

= Running the Background Nodes =
  # In a new terminal window, start the dragonbot relay:
{{{
> roslaunch dragonbot_relay dragonbot_relay.launch
}}}
  # In another terminal window, start the dragonbot pubsub:
{{{
> roscd dragonbot_pubsub
> build/install/dragonbot_pubsub/bin/dragonbot_pubsub edu.yale.dragonbot.DragonbotNode
}}}
  # In a third terminal window, start the background nodes:
{{{
> export ROS_IP=[your IP address here]
> export ROS_HOSTNAME=[your IP address here]
> roslaunch expeditions_year1 background_nodes.launch
}}}
  # Start the tablet and connect to your computer.  It should display a long list of GUIs.

= Running the Introduction =
The introduction is a short (~1-2 minute) speech by the robot, starting from being asleep and ending with being asleep. The tablet is used to wake the robot up: the GUI will change to a single button that says "wakeup".  Press it and wait a few seconds and the robot will wakeup and start talking.  To run the introduction:

  # Run all of the background nodes and setup as above.
  # Set the IP and run the introduction:
{{{
> export ROS_IP=[your IP address here]
> export ROS_HOSTNAME=[your IP address here]
> rosrun expeditions_year1 intro.py
}}}
